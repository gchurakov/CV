Hello! Thank's taking the time to consider my candidature. 
I would like to tell you a bit more about myself, I am a student of NIU HSE-Perm Software Engineering 3rd year,
within the framework of my studies at the university I am engaged in improving my hard and soft skills. 
During my studies, I took part in many extracurricular activities as an organiser, 
I have skills and experience in negotiation, team management 
(I hold the position of the chairman of the student council), creative trainings at project schools. I speak English at B2 level.

As for professional skills: I encountered word processing at school, in 10-11th grade I attended 
a class on artificial intelligence, my classmates and I learnt the basics of DS/ML/DL 
(got acquainted with python syntax, learnt ways to visualise data, trained simple models, 
worked with popular datasets and tasks), then we moved on to more complex tasks, my team built a map of the work "The Master and Margarita" bby Bulgakov, 
in the solution we used transfomers, RuBERT (from DeepPavlov) to search for named entities, the complexity of the task was also that would understand - 
the real location is described in the text or not. Now I am studying for a minor: Neural Network Technologies. 
I transferred to it from minor : Applied Mathematics after 3 semesters (NS minor is much more interesting to me). 
We study text processing, signal processing, image processing, touch on different technologies and concepts, 
I'll tell you about a couple of the most interesting ones I've done: transfer learning (image classification), GAN (sinusoid generation).

At the moment, I'm doing NLP research: translation systems often don't take into account the peculiarities of languages,
it is not an easy task to build the word order of a sentence taking into account the rules and language habits of native speakers.
Also, in conjunction with this research, I am taking an online course AI Safety Fundamentals, I
believe that the problem of understanding AI systems and the reasoning behind their decision making is becoming a higher priority 
for development at the moment, and the further it goes, the more acute the issue will become.

In my free time I am preparing for a half-marathon, training in the gym, reading fiction, interested in technology, 
repairing home appliances, laptops, listening to techno, meeting interesting people.

Thank you for your attention! Churakov G.A.
